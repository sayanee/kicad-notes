# Creativity Unleashed: Discover, Hone, and Share Your Voice Online

- Would I find this helpful, interesting, valuable?
- Focus internally
- You are never late. Art is always evolving. Internet is still in its infancy.
- Likes and followers are quantitative measures, not quality of depth of impact.
- You are unique. Something original to offer is always there.
- You cannot please everyone. Criticism will always be there. Consuming excessive feedback back be counter-productive.
- We don't see all the years of struggle before the success of others
- Focus on experimentation and putting out a lot of work
- Obstacles, doubt, uncertainties are part of the process
- As a beginner, there are no expectations
- Be coherent (not complete) with themes and type of content
- Core themes for personal, career and projects
- Self expression is a game of incomplete expression
- Look to previous work for clues and compassion for future work
- Slow, but consistent pace is ok! It compounds over the years.
