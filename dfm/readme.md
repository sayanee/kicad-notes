## [Manufacturing Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwwqUoS5PAE)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/desige-for)

Types of products:

- high volume consumer product - manual production
- super high volume with liquid - automated production
- clothing - highest margin, lowest cost, labour intensive

Where to build?

- Why China?
    - Cost-sensitive
    - more than 10k units
    - Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) of 1000s
    - Manual labour going towards automation
    - Human vs machine automation is still a huge challenge
    - has physically protected IP
- Why not China?
    - Language
    - Far away for communication
    - Labour wages are going up
    - Currency is going up
    - Super low volume
    - Super high volume with automation
    - Sensitive to shipping cost if the product is huge
    - Military / government product

## [Selection of Process and Material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CldW3vs_es4)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/design-for-manufacturing-course-3-selection-of-process-and-materials)

Start by minimizing parts

- Relative motion?
- Different material?
- Required separate for assembly?

Calculate **Assembly Index**:

`100 * N_m * T_m / T_a`

- `N_m` minimum number of parts required
- `T_m` assume ideal assembly time of `3sec` per step
- Itemize each step and estimate actual assembly time `T_a`
- Calculate the ratio of theoretical time / actual time
- Low volume electromechanical `25%` is a good target

Process and material selection:

- Select in early phase
- Consider options keeping in mind CM's capabilities
- Parts, assembly and materials are closely linked to process
- Reduce number of secondary operations

Material & Process considerations:

1. Production volume (10x)
1. Budget
1. Schedule
1. Experience and design tools
1. Part geometry
1. Service and environmental requirements
    - user replaceable? water proof?
1. Aesthetics
1. Accuracy
    - Precision equipment?

Shape attributes:

- Depressions?
- Uniform wall?
- Uniform cross-section?
- Axis of rotation?
- Regular cross section?
- Captured cavity?
- Enclosed Cavity?
- No Draft?

Process comparison tools:

1. Comparison matrix of shape generation vs processes
1. Comparison matrix of materials vs processes
1. Production Volume vs Cost comparison among process A, B, C
1. Rank processes by:
    - throughput and batch size
    - schedule
    - production rate
    - bottlenecks
    - materials handling
    - cycle time
    - economics

## [Quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1QHBtY_e7Y)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/design-for-manufacturing-class-9-quality)

Quality is:

- customer-based
- manufacturing-based
- product-based
- value-based
- transcendent

Negative quality:

- lower quality for price
- groupthink
- getting away with little less and increasing it step by step

Characterizing problem:

- By Severity
    - personal injury
    - property damage
    - product return
    - irritation and dissatisfaction
- By Likelihood
    - probability of occurrence
- By Detectability
    - warn and inform!
    - hidden hazards are most dangerous

Designing safe products

- Acceptable safety?
- Intrinsic safety?
- Redundancy and fake Redundancy?

Reliability

- cost budget
- weight budget
- volume budget
- performance budget
- failure budget
    - `4%` retail returns
        - `1.6%` defective returns
            - `0.55%` unanticipated
            - `0.4%` actual defects in warranty
            - `0.65%` factory quality defect
        - `2.4%` non-defective returns

Six Sigma

- +/- 6 sigma in standard deviation
- 1/1 billion at tail end on both sides of the graph
- measure failure rates at sub-assembly processes
- all failures must be fixed at test phase

[Some important numbers](https://www.asknumbers.com/WhatisReliability.aspx)

- availability
- failure
- maintainability
- MTBF - not that important, more important is warranty period
- fix the tolerances and dimensions, not the design or materials

## [Test design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCnTUOxMl_4)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/design-for-manufacturing-class-10-test-design-strategy)

2 types of testing:

- design verification testing
- production testing

Test conditions:

- Normal use
- Abnormal use
- Abuse
- Life and reliability

2 types of data:

- Attribute data: Pass / Fail
- Variable data: Sensors

Test coverage:

- 100% testing is best
- Sample testing

Component Life test and redesign

- important components are life tested
- make the test as realistic as possible!
- no such thing as a fluke!
- product is guilty until proven innocent

System life testing

- Some problems can only be found when testing the entire system
    - Software
    - Electrical noise
- Pass component testing first, then system testing


## [Design for manual assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sheZ6bffiWU)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/design-for-manufacturing-class-11-design-for-manual-assembly-part-1-techniques)

Goal:

- reduce parts count
- reduce time taken for each step

Why fewer parts count?

- lower cost
- less docs
- lesser suppliers
- fewer inspections
- fewer number of different parts to keep in inventory
- fewer rework
- lower tolerance stack-up
- lower tooling cost
- fewer Materials
- higher quality!

Manual assembly vs Robot assembly: pros and cons

Manual assembly challenges:

- finger grasp
- small size
- hot
- fingers cannot access the location

DFA guidelines:

- self-aligning
- self-location
- standardized parts
- robust and sloppy tolerances
- eliminate adjustments
- minimize re-orientation
- make mating features grossly asymmetric
- eliminate flexible parts
- force correct assembly
- make parts symmetrically so that orientation is unimportant

Best practices:

| Bad | Good |
| ------ | ------ |
| asymmetrical | symmetrical
| slight asymmetrical | pronounced asymmetrical
| will jam | cannot jam
| will tangle | cannot tangle
| part must be released before located | part located before release

## [Boothroyd Dewhurst Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcZRB0PpIPc)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/design-for-manufacturing-class-11-design-for-manual-assembly-part-2-boothroyd-dewhurst-method)

Definition:

- cost ∝ assembly line
- time and quality --> lower number of parts and ease of assembly
- analyzing part count and geometry to calculate theoretical assembly line

> The Boothroyd Dewhurst Method involves systematically looking at the part geometry and how they're fastened to estimate a time to put the different parts together. Then, adding it up and comparing it to a **theoretical minimum part count** (what's the fewest number of possible parts you could have to build the product). You will then get a ratio of the two to get an overall design efficiency. The actual number does not matter as it's **intended as a benchmarking tool**; as you improve the design you have some benchmarks or some comparison points so you know this design is better or worse than that your previous design.

Value of the BD Method:

> Most importantly, this method forces you to take a step back because everything is so rushed to get the actual product working and you're thinking about so many things. The Boothroyd Dewhurst method lets you pop up a level and think specifically about assembly and ask questions: **Do I really need two parts? Can I put them together with snap fit rather than screws? It is those key insights that are important.**
