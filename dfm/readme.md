> From prototype to high volume manufacturing

## [Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84VxN9K_PMM)

- Easier than ever to build a prototype
- Harder than ever to bring it to production
- What is manufacturable from a design standpoint?
- How to pick a great factory?
- How to do costing and pricing?

## [Manufacturing Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwwqUoS5PAE)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/desige-for)

Types of products:

- high volume consumer product - manual production
- super high volume with liquid - automated production
- clothing - highest margin, lowest cost, labour intensive

Where to build?

- Why China?
    - Cost-sensitive
    - more than 10k units
    - Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) of 1000s
    - Manual labour going towards automation
    - Human vs machine automation is still a huge challenge
    - has physically protected IP
- Why not China?
    - Language
    - Far away for communication
    - Labour wages are going up
    - Currency is going up
    - Super low volume
    - Super high volume with automation
    - Sensitive to shipping cost if the product is huge
    - Military / government product

Contract Manufacturer (CM) selection process

1. Talk with trusted network connections who have manufacturing experience
1. Create a differentiated list of 5-10 CMs
1. Down select to 3-5 factories based on your product category
1. Create a Request for Quote (RFQ) package
1. Visit!
1. Analyze results
1. Negotiate big items
1. Talk with CM's customers
1. Select the winner, leave others on good terms

RFQ Package

- Company overview (Word processor)
    - Team
    - Funding
    - Product
    - What's done
    - What needs to be done
    - Factory Criteria
- BOM (Spreadsheet)
    - Transparent and formula driven
    - Separate standard, special and consigned margins/markups
    - Include all costs to ex-factory / loading dock
- Schedule
    - Gantt chart

Factory visit checklist:

- [ ] Do you like the team? Are they experienced and friendly?
- [ ] Do they have the right manufacturing capabilities?
- [ ] Does your intended volume match their volume capabilities?
- [ ] Are they financially stable?
- [ ] Do they have enough working capital to get along?
- [ ] Do they have favorable payment terms?
- [ ] Are they transparent in their costing?
- [ ] Do they take IP seriously? Did they show something they shouldn't have?
- [ ] Are they ethical in their treatment of their workers?
- [ ] Do you have access to upper management?
- [ ] Are they excited about working on your product?

## [Manufacturing Triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBaJwKuShyo)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/design-for-manufacturing)

Triangle of constraints

- Cost
- Schedule
- Quality

Other BOM costs:

- Electronics components
- Mechanical components
- Decorations
- Packaging
- Labour
- Transportation

Schedule:

- International: Christmas
- China: New Year and National Week

Example base rate:

- 3 rounds of prototypes: ~ 2 years
- 1st Factory round: ~0.5 years
- Final engineering product: ~0.5 years

Product complexity index (PCI):

- New accessory - 2 weeks
- New version with some changes - 3 weeks
- New generation with many changes - 4 weeks
- New product line (complicated) - 4.5 weeks
- New product line (very complicated) - 5 weeks

Detailed milestones:

- Form CM team
- Contact lists / roles / responsibilities
- ME and EE file transfers
- Works like / looks like samples
- Exchange trips for relationship building
- Factory input
- Components
- Engineering
- Quality
- Production planning
- Sourcing / Costing
- Logistics
- Process
- Financials
- Pre-production milestones
- Tool release
- Tool start (TS)
- First shots (FS)
- Engineering Pilot (EP) EP1, EP2, EP3
- Production Pilot (PP)
- Production
- Production Start (PS)
- Ramp
- Engineering Change Notice
- Sustaining (Quality Up / Cost down)
- Sunset

Quality

- Use good ingredients
- Use sub-components
- Statistical Process Control (SPC) / Yield
- Find out now, not later
- Sample testing
- Final inspection
- Acceptable Quality Levels (AQL)
- Walk the line
- Easier and less expensive to make changes
- What happens when something fails?
- Quality is rarely considered in the engineering phase
- Unknown unknowns
- How do you know the product is good?

## [Selection of Process and Material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CldW3vs_es4)

[Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/dragoninnovation/design-for-manufacturing-course-3-selection-of-process-and-materials)

Start by minimizing parts

- Relative motion?
- Different material?
- Required separate for assembly?

Calculate **Assembly Index**:

`100 * N_m * T_m / T_a`

- `N_m` minimum number of parts required
- `T_m` assume ideal assembly time of `3sec` per step
- Itemize each step and estimate actual assembly time `T_a`
- Calculate the ratio of theoretical time / actual time
- Low volume electromechanical `25%` is a good target

Process and material selection:

- Select in early phase
- Consider options keeping in mind CM's capabilities
- Parts, assembly and materials are closely linked to process
- Reduce number of secondary operations

Material & Process considerations:

1. Production volume (10x)
1. Budget
1. Schedule
1. Experience and design tools
1. Part geometry
1. Service and environmental requirements
    - user replaceable? water proof?
1. Aesthetics
1. Accuracy
    - Precision equipment?

Shape attributes:

- Depressions?
- Uniform wall?
- Uniform cross-section?
- Axis of rotation?
- Regular cross section?
- Captured cavity?
- Enclosed Cavity?
- No Draft?

Process comparison tools:

1. Comparison matrix of shape generation vs processes
1. Comparison matrix of materials vs processes
1. Production Volume vs Cost comparison among process A, B, C
1. Rank processes by:
    - throughput and batch size
    - schedule
    - production rate
    - bottlenecks
    - materials handling
    - cycle time
    - economics

- little post production steps
- good surface finish
- simplifies assembly
- fully automated

Injection molding disadvantages:

- high tooling cost
- difficult to make changes
- only thermoplastics
- large undercuts are difficult

Process:

1. High pressure e.g. `12k psi`

Design guidelines:

1. wall thickness
1. draft - use [Moldflow](https://www.autodesk.com/products/moldflow/overview) or software for draft analysis
1. no sharp edges
1. planar parting guidelines
1. tolerance
1. surface finish
