# The Writer’s Workbench

> 50 Tools You Can Use by Roy Peter Clark

## Nuts and Bolts

> "Never use the passive when you can use the active." - George Orwell

- Begin sentences with subjects and verbs
- Use verbs in the simple present or past tense
    - E.g. Change "It was her observation that..." to "She observed..."
- Use long sentences to note things in chronological order or a list

DO NOT USE:

- Sort of
- Tend to
- Kind of
- Must have
- Seemed to
- Could have
- Use to

> "Vigorous writing is concise," wrote William Strunk

## Special Effects

- Do not repeat words which are unnecessary
- Repeat words which are necessary E.g. Lincoln's people in "government of the people, by the people, for the people"
- Recognise **unintended repetition**
- Types of words:
    - Function words (“said” or “that”)
    - Foundation words (“house” or “river”)
    - Distinctive words (“silhouette” or “jingle”)
- All of us possess a **reading vocabulary** as big as a lake but draw from a **writing vocabulary** as small as a pond
- “Never use a **metaphor, simile or other figure of speech** which you are used to seeing in print,” writes George Orwell.
- Greater the complexity, shorter the sentence
- Control the pace of the story by varying sentence length
- Vary paragraph lengths
- Good writers move up and down the ladder of abstraction
    - An old essay by John Updike begins, “We live in an era of gratuitous inventions and negative improvements.” (higher abstraction) The answer is in his second sentence: “Consider the beer can.” (lower abstraction)
- Number of elements
    - Use one for power.
    - Use two for comparison, contrast.
    - Use three for completeness, wholeness, roundness.
    - Use four or more to list, inventory, compile and expand.

## Blueprints

- Who becomes Character
- What becomes Action (what happened)
- Where becomes Setting
- When becomes Chronology
- Why becomes Motivation or Causality
- How becomes Process (how it happened)
- When people speak in stories, readers listen. But people speak in different ways
- Outline: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, instrumental, verse, chorus, coda
- Divide the story into its big parts, name the parts and make visible a movement of theme, logic and chronology that readers can perceive and remember
- Standard camera angles:
    - Aerial view: The writer looks down upon the world, as if he were standing atop a skyscraper or viewing the ground from a blimp
    - Establishing shot: The writer stands back to capture the setting in which the action will take place, describing the world that the reader is about to enter, sometimes creating a mood for the story
    - Middle distance: The camera moves closer to the action, close enough to see the key players and their interaction. This is the common distance for most stories written for the newspaper.
    - Close-up: The camera gets in the face of the subject, close enough to detect anger, fear, dread, sorrow, irony, the full range of human emotions.
    - Extreme close-up: This writer focuses on an important detail that would be invisible from a distance
- Broken line: Report, Analyze, Explain
- Endings:
    - Closing the circle — The ending reminds us of the beginning by returning to an important place or reintroducing us to a key character
    - The tie-back — ties his ending to some odd or offbeat element in the body of the story.
    - The time frame — The writer creates a tick-tock structure with time advancing relentlessly
    - The space frame — The writer is less concerned with time than with place or geography
    - The payoff — The longer the story, the more important the payoff. This does not require a “happy ending,” but a satisfying one, a reward for a journey concluded, a secret revealed, a mystery solved.
    - The epilogue — The story ends, but life goes on
    - Problem and solution— This common structure suggests its own ending.
    - The apt quote — Often overused, this technique remains a sturdy tool for ending stories
    - Look to the future — Most stories and reports are about things that have already happened
    - Mobilize the reader — The end of a story or report can point the reader in another direction

## Useful habits

- You will never be able to reach your potential as a writer unless you take an interest in all the associated news and literary crafts
- Examples: photgrapher, designer, editor, clerks, marketer
- Get feedback
    - From a pacer
    - From someone who understands my quirks
    - From someone who can answer my questions
    - From someone who helps me figure out what works and what needs work
- How to receive negative feedback
    - Do not fall into the trap of arguing about matters of taste.
    - Do not, as a reflex, defend your work against negative criticism.
    - Explain to your critic what you were attempting to do.
    - Transform arguments into conversations.
    - Even when the attack is personal, try to deflect it in your mind back onto the work. “What was it in the story that would provoke such anger?”
- The struggle turns out to be not just a confidence game, but a con game, a cognitive distortion, a self-fulfilling prophecy, the best excuse in the world for not writing.
- Strategies:
    - Trust your hand: get to work!
    - Adopt a daily routine
    - Build in rewards
    - Draft sooner: Write earlier in the process so you discover what information you need
    - Count everything: Learn to judge your own work by quantity, not quality
    - Rewrite: The quality comes from revision, rather than from speed writing
    - Set the table: Take a day to throw things away, answer messages and prepare the altar for the next day of writing
    - Find a rabbi
    - Keep a daybook

> “A page a day is a book a year.”

- Limit self-criticism at the beginning. Turn it loose during revision.
- The critic becomes useful only when enough work has been done to warrant evaluation and revision.

> Brenda Ueland fights the battle against internal and external criticism with the passion of a warrior princess and the zeal of a suffragette. She titles one of her chapters: “Why Women who do too much housework should neglect it for their writing.”

- Weapons against the watcher / the critique mind:
    - Deadlines
    - Writing fast
    - Writing at odd times
    - Writing when you’re tired
    - Writing on cheap paper
    - Writing in surprising forms from which no one expects excellence
- Process: Idea. Collect. Focus. Draft. Clarify.
