## 1. Before you get started

Readings:

1. Startup Owner's Manual
1. Business Model Generation

Download [Business Model Canvas](https://canvanizer.com/downloads/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf)

## 2. What we now know

Modern corporation:

- `1602` Dutch East India Co.
- `1908` Harvard MBA
    - 300 years after the first corporation
    - learn how to run **existing** corporations

Startups are not smaller versions of large companies!

| | Startups | Big companies
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Mode | Search | Execution
| Solve via | Iteration | Repetition
| Idea | Searching | Proven
| Strategy | Business Model hypothesis | Operating plan and financial plan
| Operations are | Unpredictable | Somewhat very predictable
| Process | Customer development + Agile | Product management + Agile/Waterfall
| Organization | Founder-driven, customer development team | Functional organization by department
| Education | Business model design, customer development, startup team building, entrepreneurial finance, Agile development, marketing | Organizational Behaviors, HR Management, Accounting, Modeling, Strategy, Operations, Leadership, Marketing, Manufacturing

Fact-based, not faith based!

❌ Not a way to build startups ❌

Timeline:

1. Concept
1. Development
1. Testing
1. Launch

Teams:

- Marketing
- Sales
- Business Development
- Engineering

Waterfall development: Assumes from day 1 that you know the problem and customer need

1. Requirements
1. Design
1. Implement
1. Verify
1. Maintain

Wrong assumptions:

- customer problems are known
- product features are known
- problems are known
- all features are known

Most startups **fail from a lack of customers** than from a failure of product development.

Customer development

1. customer discovery
1. customer validation -> feedback to step 1 via an iteration
1. customer creation
1. company building

Possible future of any startup:

- Grow into a company
- Pivot and iteration as it continues to search for a business model
- Grow very slowly and barely break even
- Run out of money and shutdown

## 3. 4. Business models and customer development

Company

> A company is a business organization which **sells a product or service** in exchange for **revenue and profit**.

Startup

> A startup is a **temporary** organization **designed to search for a repeatable and scalable** business model. The goal of a startup is NOT to become a startup!

Business Model

> How a company **created value for itself** while delivering products or services for customers.

1. Value proposition

    - customers don't care about your technology!
    - problems vs need

    - why would they buy?
    - what is their demographics?
1. Channels
    - retail / store / physical
    - web / mobile / cloud
1. Customer relationships
    - how to get customers?
    - how to keep customers?

Business Model Canvas:

- Hypothesis == Guesses
- How do we change those guesses from facts?
- Design experiments, run tests, get data to validate
- Pivot via feedback

Customer Development

- Founder must do it!
- Don't use employees or proxies

Founders can:

- change the product
- make pivots
- hear customer feedback first-hand

Minimal Viable Product

- build minimum product to get feedback
- prevent wastage of time, people, money and resources

Pivot:

- What do we do when Hypothesis do not match the Reality?
- An iteration is a minor change
- Fire the hypothesis, not people (Founder or the employees)!
- Constant speed, with constant tempo

**Customer discovery**:

1. State the Hypothesis
    - via the Business Model Canvas
1. Test the problem
    - Build the wireframe or prototype
    - Testing your understanding of the customers
1. Test the solution
    - Build a high fidelity app or prototype
    - Match value proposition and customers (**Product-Market Fit**)
1. Pivot or proceed

**Customer validation**:

1. Get ready to sell
    - Acquire / activate customers
    - Build high fidelity MVP
    - Develop sales collateral
    - sales roadmap
1. Get out of the building
1. Develop positioning
1. Verify   
    - Are you sure you have a repeatable and scalable business model?
    - Are you ready to scale marketing and sales spending?

Market opportunity / analysis

- Identify a customer and market need
- Size the market
- Competitions
- Growth potential

Narrowing markets:

1. Total addressable market
    - how big is the universe?
1. Total served available market
    - how many can i reach with my sales channel?
1. Target market
    - who will be most likely buyers?

Total available market

- how big is the pie?
- how many people would want / need the product?

- how do I found out? Industry analyst, Wall street analyst

Total served available market

- how big is the served available market?
- how many people need / can use this product?

- Content creators / Advertisers: Facebook

Multiple customer segments:

- Each has its own **value proposition**
- Each has its own **revenue stream**
- One segment cannot exist without the other

Market types:

1. Existing market
1. Re-segmented market
1. New market
1. Clone market

Market properties:

- Market size
- Cost of entry
- Launch type
- Competitive barriers
- Positioning

Types of sales depends on the market:

- Sale model
- Margins
- Sales cycle
- Chasm width

Type of financing depends on the market:

Customers:

- Needs
- Adoption

| Market type | Customers | Customer needs | Competitors | Risk | Examples | Chasm | Sales graph
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Existing | Known | Performance | Many | Lack of branding, sales, distribution | Google in Internet search | almost does not exist | linear
| Re-segmented | Possibly known | Better fit | Many if wrong, few if right | Market and product re-definition | Southwest Airlines in Aviation | Can be big | exponential or tapering off without any growth
| New | Unknown | Transformational improvement | None | Evangelism and education | Groupon in daily deals market | Big gap | initial hype, then huge dip, then possibly exponential
| Clone market | Possibly known | Local version | None | Musjudging the local needs | Baidu

Expected time to profitability:

1. Existing markets
1. Clone markets
1. Re-segmented markets
1. New markets

Existing market:

- Incumbents exist!
- Customers can name the market
- Customers want / need better performance
- Usually technology driven
- Positioning driven by product and how much value customers place on its features

Risks in existing markets on incumbents:

- Network effects of incumbents
- Incumbents will defend their turf
- Assuming that incumbents are dumb
- Incumbents are also innovating

New market:

- how to move the exponential part of sales graph earlier?
- assuming sales graph is linear
- there are no customers, so revenues might flatten for years
- don't act like existing market by hiring huge sales and marketing
- premature spending is the killer for startups

**No startup can single-handedly accelerate technology diffusion**

Clone market:

- takes foreign business mode and adapts it to local conditions
    - language
    - culture
    - import restrictions
    - local control / ownership
- need a market large enough > 100 million E.g. BRIC

```
List price = cost of goods + R&D + Selling costs + Admin cost + reseller cost + profit
```

OEM channel economics:

```
Revenue = COGS + SGA + Profit + Reseller cost
```

## 8. Customer Relationships

3 parts:

- Get
- Keep
- Grow

Questions:

- What's their role?
- Who are they?
- How do they buy?
- What matters?

Get methods - feed the funnel:

- Awareness
- Interest
- Consideration
- Purchase

Types of activities:

1. Paid demand creation activities
    - PR
    - advertising
    - Trade shows
    - webinars
    - E-mail / direct mail
    - Search engine marketing
1. Earned demand creation activities
    - Publications in journals
    - Conferences / speeches
    - Blogging / Guest articles
    - Social Media

Keep customer activities  - Physical channel:

- Loyalty programs E.g. Airlines, Credit cards
- Product updates
- Customer satisfaction

Grow customers:

- Un-bundling
- Up-sell
- Next-sell
- Cross-sell
- Referrals

Get customers (Web channel):

- Acquire - `10,000` clicks for $0.50 per click = $5000
- Activate - `500` took a trial (`5%` signs up)
- Pay - `50` actually pays (`10%` or $100 for **Customer Acquisition Cost**)

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):

1. PPC (Pay per customer) = `$0.75`
1. Acquire = `4075`
1. Activate = `3.75%`

```
(0.75*4075) $3056 Total paid, 153 (3.75% * 4075) people signed up = $20 PPC
```

Keep customers: calculate the **Churn**

- `5%` when they stay for `20 months`
- `1%` when they stay for `100 months` --> More revenue by keeping the churn low

Lifetime value (LTV) - how much will a customer pay through the lifetime?

```
LTV > CAC
```

3 short forms:

- PPC **Pay per customer**
- CAC **Customer acquisition Cost**
- LTV **Lifetime Value**
