## Fallacy of building Startups

❌ Not a way to build startups ❌

Timeline:

1. Concept
1. Development
1. Testing
1. Launch

Teams:

- Marketing
- Sales
- Business Development
- Engineering

Waterfall development: Assumes from day 1 that you know the problem and customer need

1. Requirements
1. Design
1. Implement
1. Verify
1. Maintain

Wrong assumptions:

- customer problems are known
- product features are known
- problems are known
- all features are known

Most startups **fail from a lack of customers** than from a failure of product development.

## Customer development

1. customer discovery
1. customer validation -> feedback to step 1 via an iteration
1. customer creation
1. company building
