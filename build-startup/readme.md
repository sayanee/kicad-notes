## 2. What we now know

Modern corporation:

- `1602` Dutch East India Co.
- `1908` Harvard MBA
    - 300 years after the first corporation
    - learn how to run **existing** corporations

Startups are not smaller versions of large companies!

| | Startups | Big companies
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Mode | Search | Execution
| Solve via | Iteration | Repetition
| Idea | Searching | Proven
| Strategy | Business Model hypothesis | Operating plan and financial plan
| Operations are | Unpredictable | Somewhat very predictable
| Process | Customer development + Agile | Product management + Agile/Waterfall
| Organization | Founder-driven, customer development team | Functional organization by department
| Education | Business model design, customer development, startup team building, entrepreneurial finance, Agile development, marketing | Organizational Behaviors, HR Management, Accounting, Modeling, Strategy, Operations, Leadership, Marketing, Manufacturing

Fact-based, not faith based!

### Fallacy of building Startups

❌ Not a way to build startups ❌

Timeline:

1. Concept
1. Development
1. Testing
1. Launch

Teams:

- Marketing
- Sales
- Business Development
- Engineering

Waterfall development: Assumes from day 1 that you know the problem and customer need

1. Requirements
1. Design
1. Implement
1. Verify
1. Maintain

Wrong assumptions:

- customer problems are known
- product features are known
- problems are known
- all features are known

Most startups **fail from a lack of customers** than from a failure of product development.

Customer development

1. customer discovery
1. customer validation -> feedback to step 1 via an iteration
1. customer creation
1. company building

Possible future of any startup:

- Grow into a company
- Pivot and iteration as it continues to search for a business model
- Grow very slowly and barely break even
- Run out of money and shutdown

## 3. Business models and customer development

Company

> A company is a business organization which **sells a product or service** in exchange for **revenue and profit**.

Startup

> A startup is a **temporary** organization **designed to search for a repeatable and scalable** business model. The goal of a startup is NOT to become a startup!

Business Model

> How a company **created value for itself** while delivering products or services for customers.

1. Value proposition
    - what problems are you solving?
    - who are the customers?
    - customers don't care about your technology!
    - problems vs need
1. Customer segments
    - who are they customers?
    - why would they buy?
    - what is their demographics?
1. Channels
    - retail / store / physical
    - web / mobile / cloud
1. Customer relationships
    - how to get customers?
    - how to keep customers?
    - how to grow customers?
    - Get, Keep, Grow funnel
1. Revenue streams?
    - what value is the customer paying for?
    - freemium?
    - license? subscription?
1. Resources
    - most important assets?
    - capital, credit
    - factory? machines? cars?
    - intellectual property?
    - talent?
1. Partners?
    - what are we acquiring from partners?
    - what key activities do they perform?
1. Activities?
    - production? making?
    - problem solving? consulting?
    - managing supply chain?
    - what do we need to become an expert at?
1. Costs?
    - people, building, materials?
    - most expensive activities and materials?
    - fixed cost and variable costs?

Business Model Canvas:

- Hypothesis == Guesses
- How do we change those guesses from facts?
- Design experiments, run tests, get data to validate
- Pivot via feedback

Customer Development

- Founder must do it!
- Don't use employees or proxies

Founders can:

- change the product
- make pivots
- hear customer feedback first-hand

Minimal Viable Product

- build minimum product to get feedback
- prevent wastage of time, people, money and resources

Pivot:

- What do we do when Hypothesis do not match the Reality?
- An iteration is a minor change
- Fire the hypothesis, not people (Founder or the employees)!
- Constant speed, with constant tempo

**Customer discovery**:

1. State the Hypothesis
    - via the Business Model Canvas
1. Test the problem
    - Build the wireframe or prototype
    - Testing your understanding of the customers
1. Test the solution
    - Build a high fidelity app or prototype
    - Match value proposition and customers (**Product-Market Fit**)
1. Pivot or proceed

**Customer validation**:

1. Get ready to sell
    - Acquire / activate customers
    - Build high fidelity MVP
    - Develop sales collateral
    - sales roadmap
1. Get out of the building
1. Develop positioning
1. Verify   
    - Are you sure you have a repeatable and scalable business model?
    - Are you ready to scale marketing and sales spending?

Market opportunity / analysis

- Identify a customer and market need
- Size the market
- Competitions
- Growth potential

Narrowing markets:

1. Total addressable market
    - how big is the universe?
1. Total served available market
    - how many can i reach with my sales channel?
1. Target market
    - who will be most likely buyers?

Total available market

- how big is the pie?
- how many people would want / need the product?
- how large is the market if they all bought?
- how do I found out? Industry analyst, Wall street analyst

Total served available market

- how big is the served available market?
- how many people need / can use this product?
- how many have the money to buy?
- understand in dollars / units
- how do i find out? talk to potential customers

Target market

- Who am i going to sell to in the year 1, 2, 3?
- How many customers is that?
- How large if they all bought?
- How do i find out? potential customers, channel partners, competitors

**Startup has ever exceeded their estimated target market size**
