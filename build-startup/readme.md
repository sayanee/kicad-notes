## 2. What we now know

Modern corporation:

- `1602` Dutch East India Co.
- `1908` Harvard MBA
    - 300 years after the first corporation
    - learn how to run **existing** corporations

Startups are not smaller versions of large companies!

| | Startups | Big companies
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Mode | Search | Execution
| Solve via | Iteration | Repetition
| Idea | Searching | Proven
| Strategy | Business Model hypothesis | Operating plan and financial plan
| Operations are | Unpredictable | Somewhat very predictable
| Process | Customer development + Agile | Product management + Agile/Waterfall
| Organization | Founder-driven, customer development team | Functional organization by department
| Education | Business model design, customer development, startup team building, entrepreneurial finance, Agile development, marketing | Organizational Behaviors, HR Management, Accounting, Modeling, Strategy, Operations, Leadership, Marketing, Manufacturing

Fact-based, not faith based!

### Fallacy of building Startups

❌ Not a way to build startups ❌

Timeline:

1. Concept
1. Development
1. Testing
1. Launch

Teams:

- Marketing
- Sales
- Business Development
- Engineering

Waterfall development: Assumes from day 1 that you know the problem and customer need

1. Requirements
1. Design
1. Implement
1. Verify
1. Maintain

Wrong assumptions:

- customer problems are known
- product features are known
- problems are known
- all features are known

Most startups **fail from a lack of customers** than from a failure of product development.

Customer development

1. customer discovery
1. customer validation -> feedback to step 1 via an iteration
1. customer creation
1. company building

Possible future of any startup:

- Grow into a company
- Pivot and iteration as it continues to search for a business model
- Grow very slowly and barely break even
- Run out of money and shutdown

## 3. Business models and customer development

Company

> A company is a business organization which **sells a product or service** in exchange for **revenue and profit**.

Startup

> A startup is a **temporary** organization **designed to search for a repeatable and scalable** business model. The goal of a startup is NOT to become a startup!

Business Model

> How a company **created value for itself** while delivering products or services for customers.
