## Focused versus Diffused Thinking?

- Focused vs Diffused modes of thinking in the brain
- Can't access both modes of thinking at the same time
- Focused mode has familiar patterns of thinking
- Diffused mode has new or novel or different patterns of thinkings
- Brain connectivity is dynamic - new synapses form and others disappear
- You are not the same person after a sleep

**Example**: Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali used wake-up methods with grasping key or ball bearing in their hands and then waking up immediately after hearing the noise from the objects dropped on the floor

## Procrastination, Memory and sleep

- use Pomodoro technique to help with procrastination
    - 25 minutes
    - no interruptions
    - focus
    - reward
- Neural thought patterns
    - axon
    - neuron
    - synapses
    - dendrite
- Building strong neural structures
    - a little every day
    - not cramming every thing in one day
- Working memory vs long term memory
    - repetition is needed for working memory
    - Can hold only 4 things at a time
- Spaced Repetition
    - 👎🏻 repeating 20 times in 1 day
    - 👍🏻 repeating 20 times over 20 days
- Sleep
    - wash away metabolic toxins
    - strengthen important parts of memories even as it erases less important memories
    - rehearse difficult material
    - makes a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems
    - understand what you are trying to learn
- How to learn?
    - learn by doing
    - ask a question during a boring lecture (active engagement)
    - Workout, hiking, being in the nature
    - Multi-task for chores like emails, meetings with context switching
    - Focus at other quieter hours without context switching
    - All neurons were present at birth, but at Hippocampus new neurons are being born
    - Surrounding yourself with events and people or exercising stimulates new neurons
    - Passion and persistence
- Other tips
    - OCEAN: Openness and disagreeability leads to higher creativity
        - Openness
        - Conscientiousness
        - Extraversion
        - Agreeableness
        - Neuroticism
    - Be more interested in the culture when learning the language
    - Not taking enough breaks will end in burn out
    - Mind map in diffused mode
    - Editing mode (focused) vs writing mode (diffused)

## Chunking

- Brand new concepts sometimes doesn't make sense
- Chunk is a network of neurons
- Build small chunks for expertise later
- New things start with heavy cognitive loads
- Build a roadmap

### How to make a chunk?

- Focus your undivided attention on a new material so that working memory can reach back other memories
- Understand so that the new material can be related back to older learnings
- Do it yourself - paint it yourself, design it yourself, sing it yourself
- Bottom up learning with chunking
- Top down learning with big picture

> One common mistake that learners make is to refuse to move on in their reading until they fully understand the material in the book in front of them. But sometimes skipping ahead can help.

### Illusions of competence

- Recalling and practicing instead of passive learning (re-reading, listening to lecture or re-writing notes)
- Retrieval/recall process itself enhances deep learning
- Merely glancing at the solution and thinking that I can do it is an illusion of competition
- Merely highlighting is also another illusion
- Test whatever you learnt by doing it yourself
- Recall in another place of study E.g. while walking, traveling
- Use concept mapping on later on after the mini-chinks are well learnt

### What motivates you?

- **Acetylcholine**: focused learning
- **Dopamine**: decision making, future rewards
- **Serotonin**: social and risk taking
- Emotions are strongly related with learning

### Library of Chunks

- **Transfer**: connecting one subject chunk to another subject chunk
    - e.g. connecting economics to physics or language to programming
- **Sequential**: step by step reasoning (focused mode)
- **Holistic**: jumping the sequence or making a global connection in intuition (diffused mode)
- **Law of Serendipity**: Lady Lick favors the one who tries
- Intuitive insights from diffused mode aren't always correct! Use focused mode to verify them.
- Learning new chunks will get progressively easier when used previously learnt chunks

### Over-learning

- When over-learning is **useful**?
    - Repeat for speech practices E.g. 70 hours to practice for 20 minute
    - Overcome nervousness with automaticity
- When over-learning is **NOT useful**?
    - Waste of time with repetition
    - Do it single session is not useful
    - Hammer away at a single nail does not strengthen long-term Memory
    - Focus on ONE technique bashing away at a nail
    - Repeat something you already know very well or the easy stuff is an illusion of competence
- Deliberate practice
    - Focus on the difficult concepts
- Einstellung or Mindset
    - Thinking with the same thought patterns in an already expert area
    - Prevents a better solution from being found
    - Prevents from being flexible or accepting a new idea
    - Can be useful or not useful
- Learning new concepts
    - Learn the smaller chunks
    - Learn which smaller chunks to use
    - Learn when to use the smaller chunks
- Interleaving
    - **Jump** between different techniques, process, concepts
    - **Mix** up learning
    - **Look ahead and skip** around the problem sets
    - **Interleave between subjects**
    - Learn from daily life non-academic mundane activities like packing for travel, handling a kid, etc

## Procrastination and Memory

- Cramming does not build solid neural structures
- Willpower is hard to come by
- Long term effects of habitual procrastination can be bad
- Procrastination gives temporary relief - like addiction
- Become a master of your habits

### Techniques

- Chunking is like habits
    1. Cue
    1. Routine
    1. Reward
    1. Belief
- Free our mind for other things to focus on

### Process vs Product

- Focus on process, not the product
- Process focuses on the habit

### Changing a habit

1. The Cue
    - location
    - time
    - how you feel
    - reactions
1. The Routine
    - Actively focus on rewiring your habit at this step!
    - Have a plan on how to have a new / different routine
    - Change only a tiny bit
    - Have a way to do it without having to use a lot of willpower
1. The Reward
    - Have an emotional payoff
    - Indulge on a food
    - Web-surfing / reading
    - Have a mini-deadline
1. The Belief
    - Hangout with like-minded people!

### Juggling life and learning

- Have a weekly list of key tasks
- Have a daily todo tasks the evening before
- Have a quitting time
- Have a leisure time
- Do the most disliked task the first thing in the morning to use your willpower E.g. 2 Pomodoro
- Keep a planner to track what works and what does not
- Gain trust in your new system

### Memory

- Visual and spacial memory
- Handwriting can help to encode
- Create a funny visual
- Create index cards
- Repeat with spaced
- Sleep is when your patterns are enhanced

### Long Term Memory

- Hippocampus is used for long term memory
- Muscle memories
- Possible to implant false memories E.g. little children
- More effective to space repeat, than all in one day
- Astrocytes are brain cells that
    - Provide nutrients to neurons
    - Maintain extracellular (outside the cell) ion balance
    - Are involved in repair after injury
    - Have a role in learning
- Memory palace is a system for putting things in a familiar place like my home

### Some tips from the interviews

- Do memory exercises to prevent dementia / Alzeihmers
- Downtime is important for the diffused mode of thinking to take effect
- When encountering obstacles, just let it go, take a break, exercise, go outdoors!
- if the body is tired, the mind is also tired!
- Taking a bath
- Single task for periods of time in days with eat, sleep, exercises
- Switch off all alerts - nothing is pushed to me!

## Renaissance Learning

### Part 1

- Exercise helps new neurons survive
- Learning, planning and language are critical
- Good judgement takes a long time
- Prefrontal cortex influences:
    - complex analysis
    - social behavior
    - decisions
    - ability to plan
- Knowledge collapse occasionally normal
- Using analogies or metaphors or models
- Learning maths / science vs sports is similar
    - repetition
    - muscle memory
    - consistency over years
- Experts rely on unconscious brain to make fast intuitive leaps
- Smaller working memory means you have more room for creativity
- Wiring between intention and control areas of the brains are not built until adulthood
- We can make significant changes in our brain, by changing how we think
- Brilliant people can also be careless and biased
- **Virtue of the less brilliant** By Santiago Ramon y Cajal
    - more persevering
    - willing to admit mistakes
    - flexible to change
- Darwin regularly walked along a path called "Thinking Path"
- Use other resources, books, history, research to learn about the same topic
- Take responsibility of your own learning
- Myth: Empathy is universally beneficial. It is not!
- Choose your battles wisely - **cool dispassion**
    - Tune people out if you discover that their interest lie in undercutting you.

> Often no matter how good your teacher and textbook are, it's only when you **sneak off and look at other books or videos** that you begin to see what you **learn through a single teacher, or book, is a partial version of the full three dimensional reality of the subject**, which has links to still other fascinating topics that are of your choosing.

### Part 2

- Right hemisphere of the brain helps us see the bigger picture
- Right hemisphere does the devil's advocate
- Left hemisphere might have a potential for rigidity
- Catch blind spots by working with other friends or experts in the subject area
- Explain and sharing work also helps in understanding and building weaker ties for jobs, projects and other opportunities
- Be careful about too much socializing among friends!!

## Test checklist

- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
- Did you work with classmates on homework problems?
- Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution?
- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions?
- Did you consult with the instructor when you were having trouble with something?
- Did you understand ALL of your homework problem solutions?
- Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problems solutions that weren't clear to you?
- Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly?
- Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one another?
- Did you attend a review session before the test?
- Did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test?

### Hard Start

- Start on the toughest problems on the test first!
    - **Difficult questions** work with the focussed mode of thinking first
    - **Easy questions** work on the diffused mode of thinking for the difficult questions
- Sometimes only after the test has ended that the answer pops up! That's because of the diffused mode. So use the diffused mode during the test itself.

### Helpful hints for tests

- Empowering beliefs on taking the test can be beneficial
- Practice deep stomach breathing
- Cover up the MCQ choices to recall
- Face your fears - Have a plan B for an alternative career
- Good worry: empowers you
- Bad worry: wastes your energy
- Go through checklists
