## Focused versus Diffused Thinking?

- Focused vs Diffused modes of thinking in the brain
- Can't access both modes of thinking at the same time
- Focused mode has familiar patterns of thinking
- Diffused mode has new or novel or different patterns of thinkings
- Brain connectivity is dynamic - new synapses form and others disappear
- You are not the same person after a sleep

**Example**: Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali used wake-up methods with grasping key or ball bearing in their hands and then waking up immediately after hearing the noise from the objects dropped on the floor

## Procrastination, Memory and sleep

    - 25 minutes
    - no interruptions
    - focus
    - reward
- Neural thought patterns
    - axon
    - neuron
    - synapses
    - dendrite
- Building strong neural structures
    - a little every day
    - not cramming every thing in one day
- Working memory vs long term memory
    - repetition is needed for working memory
    - Can hold only 4 things at a time
- Spaced Repetition
    - 👎🏻 repeating 20 times in 1 day
    - 👍🏻 repeating 20 times over 20 days
- Sleep
    - wash away metabolic toxins
    - strengthen important parts of memories even as it erases less important memories
    - rehearse difficult material
    - makes a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems

- How to learn?
    - learn by doing
    - ask a question during a boring lecture (active engagement)
    - Workout, hiking, being in the nature
    - Multi-task for chores like emails, meetings with context switching
    - Focus at other quieter hours without context switching
    - All neurons were present at birth, but at Hippocampus new neurons are being born
    - Surrounding yourself with events and people or exercising stimulates new neurons
    - Passion and persistence
