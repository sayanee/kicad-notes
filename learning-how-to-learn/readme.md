## Focused versus Diffused Thinking?

- Focused vs Diffused modes of thinking in the brain
- Can't access both modes of thinking at the same time
- Focused mode has familiar patterns of thinking
- Diffused mode has new or novel or different patterns of thinkings
- Brain connectivity is dynamic - new synapses form and others disappear
- You are not the same person after a sleep

**Example**: Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali used wake-up methods with grasping key or ball bearing in their hands and then waking up immediately after hearing the noise from the objects dropped on the floor

## Procrastination, Memory and sleep

- use Pomodoro technique to help with procrastination
    - 25 minutes
    - no interruptions
    - focus
    - reward
- Neural thought patterns
    - axon
    - neuron
    - synapses
    - dendrite
- Building strong neural structures
    - a little every day
    - not cramming every thing in one day
- Working memory vs long term memory
    - repetition is needed for working memory
    - Can hold only 4 things at a time
- Spaced Repetition
    - 👎🏻 repeating 20 times in 1 day
    - 👍🏻 repeating 20 times over 20 days
- Sleep
    - wash away metabolic toxins
    - strengthen important parts of memories even as it erases less important memories
    - rehearse difficult material
    - makes a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems
    - understand what you are trying to learn
- How to learn?
    - learn by doing
    - ask a question during a boring lecture (active engagement)
    - Workout, hiking, being in the nature
    - Multi-task for chores like emails, meetings with context switching
    - Focus at other quieter hours without context switching
    - All neurons were present at birth, but at Hippocampus new neurons are being born
    - Surrounding yourself with events and people or exercising stimulates new neurons
    - Passion and persistence
- Other tips
    - OCEAN: Openness and disagreeability leads to higher creativity
        - Openness
        - Conscientiousness
        - Extraversion
        - Agreeableness
        - Neuroticism
    - Be more interested in the culture when learning the language
    - Not taking enough breaks will end in burn out
    - Mind map in diffused mode
    - Editing mode (focused) vs writing mode (diffused)

## Chunking

- Brand new concepts sometimes doesn't make sense
- Chunk is a network of neurons
- Build small chunks for expertise later
- New things start with heavy cognitive loads
- Build a roadmap

### How to make a chunk?

- Focus your undivided attention on a new material so that working memory can reach back other memories
- Understand so that the new material can be related back to older learnings
- Do it yourself - paint it yourself, design it yourself, sing it yourself
- Bottom up learning with chunking
- Top down learning with big picture

> One common mistake that learners make is to refuse to move on in their reading until they fully understand the material in the book in front of them. But sometimes skipping ahead can help.

### Illusions of competence

- Recalling and practicing instead of passive learning (re-reading, listening to lecture or re-writing notes)
- Retrieval/recall process itself enhances deep learning
- Merely glancing at the solution and thinking that I can do it is an illusion of competition
- Merely highlighting is also another illusion
- Test whatever you learnt by doing it yourself
- Recall in another place of study E.g. while walking, traveling
- Use concept mapping on later on after the mini-chinks are well learnt

### What motivates you?

- **Acetylcholine**: focused learning
- **Dopamine**: decision making, future rewards
- **Serotonin**: social and risk taking
- Emotions are strongly related with learning

### Library of Chunks

- **Transfer**: connecting one subject chunk to another subject chunk
    - e.g. connecting economics to physics or language to programming
- **Sequential**: step by step reasoning (focused mode)
- **Holistic**: jumping the sequence or making a global connection in intuition (diffused mode)
- **Law of Serendipity**: Lady Lick favors the one who tries
- Intuitive insights from diffused mode aren't always correct! Use focused mode to verify them.
- Learning new chunks will get progressively easier when used previously learnt chunks

### Over-learning

- When over-learning is **useful**?
    - Repeat for speech practices E.g. 70 hours to practice for 20 minute
    - Overcome nervousness with automaticity
- When over-learning is **NOT useful**?
    - Waste of time with repetition
    - Do it single session is not useful
    - Hammer away at a single nail does not strengthen long-term Memory
    - Focus on ONE technique bashing away at a nail
    - Repeat something you already know very well or the easy stuff is an illusion of competence
- Deliberate practice
    - Focus on the difficult concepts
- Einstellung or Mindset
    - Thinking with the same thought patterns in an already expert area
    - Prevents a better solution from being found
    - Prevents from being flexible or accepting a new idea
    - Can be useful or not useful
- Learning new concepts
    - Learn the smaller chunks
    - Learn which smaller chunks to use
    - Learn when to use the smaller chunks
- Interleaving
    - **Jump** between different techniques, process, concepts
    - **Mix** up learning
    - **Look ahead and skip** around the problem sets
    - **Interleave between subjects**
    - Learn from daily life non-academic mundane activities like packing for travel, handling a kid, etc
